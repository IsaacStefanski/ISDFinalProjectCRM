This CRM is part of a project that simulates developing an information system for a startup. The project requirements only called for a non-working prototype, though the opportunity was there to bring some functionality to an otherwise clean, intuitive, and flexible CRM prototype. Designed with portability in mind, this prototype can be used on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smart phone. JavaScript is used to make the tool reactive.
